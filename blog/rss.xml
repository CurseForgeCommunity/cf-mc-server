            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A tool to install modpack servers, almost without having to do anything at all?</p><p>I mean, why not?</p><p>I've been sitting in the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/curseforge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CurseForge Discord</a> for a while,
and one thing that I've seen from time to time, is that people have troubles of setting up a server for the modpack they want to run (or they simple don't want to pay a server host, to solve that issue).</p><p>So, I had the stupid idea of building a tool, that could potentially solve big parts of the problems with installing servers for modpacks, as it require at least a little bit of technical knowhow.</p><p>I started building this tool, tested it a bit with my own personal modpack (really small, simple and unconfigured),
got it to work, but I still felt that it wasn't enough, since it required you to know a lot of things in beforehand.</p><p>Example on how you would install my modpack from command line, when I first started out</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_I0IT language-shell theme-code-block"><div class="codeBlockContent_wNvx" style="color:#F8F8F2;background-color:#282A36"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-shell codeBlock_jd64 thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_mRuA"><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">C:</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(248, 248, 242)">\</span><span class="token plain">minecraft-server</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(248, 248, 242)">\</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span><span class="token plain"> cf-mc-server </span><span class="token number">477455</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token number">3295539</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token string" style="color:rgb(255, 121, 198)">"c:\minecraft-server"</span><br></span></code></pre><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="copyButton_eDfN clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_W9eQ" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_XEyF" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_i9w9" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div><p>Simple, right? So let me explain what happens here..</p><p><code>477455</code> is the project ID for my modpack (<a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/too-many-projects" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Too Many Projects</a>), and <code>3295539</code> is the file ID, for the latest (only) version of my modpack.</p><p>.. and I hope you can figure out what <code>"c:\minecraft-server"</code> would do..</p><p>Now, I felt that, not everyone will be able to figure out how to get these IDs by themselves, so I wanted to make it easier to install things.</p><p>So I made an interactive installer as well, where you can search modpacks and select what version you want to install.</p><p>Here's an old video on how the installer looked while I was developing it</p><video src="https://itssimple.se/share/u/2022/03/22/0650-0a19.mp4" controls="" style="max-width:100%"></video><p>Yeah, I know. It ain't that pretty, but it sure as hell makes installing a server easier.</p><div class="admonition admonition-note alert alert--secondary"><div class="admonition-heading"><h5><span class="admonition-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="14" height="16" viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.3 5.69a.942.942 0 0 1-.28-.7c0-.28.09-.52.28-.7.19-.18.42-.28.7-.28.28 0 .52.09.7.28.18.19.28.42.28.7 0 .28-.09.52-.28.7a1 1 0 0 1-.7.3c-.28 0-.52-.11-.7-.3zM8 7.99c-.02-.25-.11-.48-.31-.69-.2-.19-.42-.3-.69-.31H6c-.27.02-.48.13-.69.31-.2.2-.3.44-.31.69h1v3c.02.27.11.5.31.69.2.2.42.31.69.31h1c.27 0 .48-.11.69-.31.2-.19.3-.42.31-.69H8V7.98v.01zM7 2.3c-3.14 0-5.7 2.54-5.7 5.68 0 3.14 2.56 5.7 5.7 5.7s5.7-2.55 5.7-5.7c0-3.15-2.56-5.69-5.7-5.69v.01zM7 .98c3.86 0 7 3.14 7 7s-3.14 7-7 7-7-3.12-7-7 3.14-7 7-7z"></path></svg></span>Things to consider</h5></div><div class="admonition-content"><p>This won't work 100% without hitches, since I don't filter away any mods from the modpacks, so if there are badly written client-only mods, they might break the server.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
