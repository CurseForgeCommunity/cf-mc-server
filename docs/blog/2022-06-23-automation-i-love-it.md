Version 1.1.0 is finally released!

In this version we added some simple automation and solutions for unavailable mods (3rd party toggle)

<!--truncate-->

You can download version 1.1.0 over at [GitHub](https://github.com/CurseForgeCommunity/cf-mc-server/releases/tag/v1.1.0). It's available for Linux, MacOS and Windows (64bit only)

## Features

-   Automatic installer based on file name (or arguments)
-   Interactive mode lets you add java arguments now (default `-Xms4G -Xmx4G`)
-   If a mod author has turned off the download possibility for 3rd party clients, we now show a list of mods that need manual attention.
