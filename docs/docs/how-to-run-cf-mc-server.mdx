This guide will help you get your first modpack server started!

## Getting Started

First of, you need to have at least one version of Java installed on your computer/server.

You can check if you have Java available in your `PATH`, by typing `java -version` in a terminal.

If you have Java, it should output something like this

```plain
C:\Users\NoLifeKing> java -version

openjdk version "11.0.12" 2021-07-20
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Microsoft-25199 (build 11.0.12+7)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Microsoft-25199 (build 11.0.12+7, mixed mode)
```

It could also output other information, this is just the version I happened to have installed.

## Downloading CF-MC-Server

You can download the latest version of the CF-MC-Server executable from [GitHub](https://github.com/CurseForgeCommunity/cf-mc-server/releases/latest).

[![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/curseforgecommunity/cf-mc-server?color=%23f16436&label=CF-MC-Server%20version&style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/CurseForgeCommunity/cf-mc-server/releases/latest)

Currently we support Windows, MacOS and Linux.

Unzip this into a directory, where you want it.

## Running the installer in interactive mode (easiest)

And then you can simply start the interactive mode like this

<Tabs groupId="operating-system">
<TabItem value="linux" label="Linux / MacOS" default>

First we need to make the executable, well, executable, so run `chmod +x ./cf-mc-server`, otherwise you can't execute anything. :)

```shell
mc-server@server ~ # chmod +x ./cf-mc-server
mc-server@server ~ # ./cf-mc-server interactive
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

```shell
C:\cf-mc-server\cf-mc-server.exe interactive
```

.. or you can just double click it. It will open the interactive installer by default since `1.0.2`

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

And within this interactive setup, you will get the options to:

-   Select path where the server is installed (or use the default)
-   Choose between using project ID or searching for project name
-   Select modpack version
-   If you want to start the server directly after it's done installing

## Running the installer without additional input (harder)

If you already know which modpack and which version you want to run, you can run the tool with arguments to tell it what and where to install it.

<Tabs groupId="operating-system">
<TabItem value="linux" label="Linux / MacOS" default>

```shell
mc-server@server ~ # ./cf-mc-server 477455 3295539 /home/mc-server/servers
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

```shell
C:\cf-mc-server\cf-mc-server.exe 477455 3295539 C:\mc-servers
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Startup script

The installer will also create a startup-script, that you can modify to include additional Java arguments, in case you want to increase memory or things like that.

If you are running Linux or MacOS, you need to make this script executable, so that you can run it afterwards.
