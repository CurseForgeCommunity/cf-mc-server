So let me explain what happens here..\\n\\n`477455` is the project ID for my modpack ([Too Many Projects](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/too-many-projects)), and `3295539` is the file ID, for the latest (only) version of my modpack.\\n\\n.. and I hope you can figure out what `\\"c:\\\\minecraft-server\\"` would do..\\n\\nNow, I felt that, not everyone will be able to figure out how to get these IDs by themselves, so I wanted to make it easier to install things.\\n\\nSo I made an interactive installer as well, where you can search modpacks and select what version you want to install.\\n\\nHere\'s an old video on how the installer looked while I was developing it\\n\\n<video src=\\"https://itssimple.se/share/u/2022/03/22/0650-0a19.mp4\\" lazy controls style={{maxWidth: \\"100%\\"}}></video>\\n\\nYeah, I know. It ain\'t that pretty, but it sure as hell makes installing a server easier.\\n\\n:::note Things to consider\\n\\nThis won\'t work 100% without hitches, since I don\'t filter away any mods from the modpacks, so if there are badly written client-only mods, they might break the server.\\n\\n:::"}]}')}}]);
